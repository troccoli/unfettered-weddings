            <p>
                Neil and Mandy wanted a humanist ceremony as they wished to acknowledge how happy and stable their
                relationship had made them.
            </p>
            <p>
                They had both been married before, and have grown-up children. They didn't want them to feel
                uncomfortable, and they were anxious that none of their children felt that their other parent was in
                any way devalued.
            </p>
            <p>
                They wanted the ceremony to be fun and light hearted.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a redacted version of the ceremony I wrote.

            <p>
                Families, friends, &quot;plus ones&quot;, gate-crashers, my name is Giulio Troccoli-Allard,
                I am a wedding celebrant accredited by Humanists UK and I will be conducting the ceremony today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mandy and Neil would like to welcome and thank you all for being here. They appreciate there are a lot
                of you, but they couldn't really say no to anyone. You are ALL very important people in their lives.
                Before we start, a few points about what is going to happen. You may have noticed that there isn't an
                official photographer. In fact there are about 150 official photographers: <span class="font-bold">YOU</span>.
                Mandy and Neil are very happy for you to snap away at any time, during and after the ceremony. For the
                duration of the ceremony however, they would like to ask you to put your phone on silent. We don't want
                to spoil all the jokes I have written, do we?

            <p>
                We are gathered here today, in this garden, to witness, celebrate and be part of the special day that is
                the wedding of Mandy and Neil.
                And speaking of the garden, we must now say thank you to George and his family for letting us into this
                wonderful place that is The Wood Cottage.
                Neil once told me that when he worked on George's roof extension, he often spent his lunch breaks
                admiring the view of this garden and beyond, rejoicing at the peace and tranquillity nature can give
                you.

                Later on, Mandy's son Stephen and Neil's daughter Laura will read for us.
                But before that, let's talk a little bit about the two amazing people who brought us here today on this
                sunny August afternoon.

            <p class="mb-4 font-bold underline underline-offset-8">Couple's story</p>
            <p>
                Mandy and Neil like to say they are a modern couple. &quot;We met online, you know&quot;,
                Mandy loves to tell everyone. That's true, but it wasn't eHarmony or Tinder.
                The matter of fact is, Mandy needed a new conservatory, and Neil was listed on checkatrade.com.
                When Mandy decided to move to the Kent's countryside a few years ago, she did it to spend more time with
                Stephen, Susan and especially her new grandson, Thomas.
                After many fruitless viewing, she saw a small cottage, with a good size garden, and she instantly fell
                in love with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The garden was South-facing so she wanted a conservatory from where she would enjoy the sun, and little
                Thomas, all day long.
                She didn't know any builders and none of her friends had any local recommendations. So she did what
                people do these days. She went online.
                Neil's name was at the top of the list, with very good reviews and a high rating. She gave him a call
                and the rest is history, as they say.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know about you, but I love history, so let's see what happened next.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a rainy April afternoon when Neil went to Mandy's house for a quote.
                In spite of the weather, Neil insisted he wanted to go out into the garden to have a better look
                at the work needed.
                He came back inside soaking wet, and Mandy offered him a hot cup of tea to give him a chance to dry.
                They started talking and two more cups of tea later, they realised they had just spent almost two hours
                chatting.
            </p>
            <p>
                When, the day after, Neil came back with a quote, Mandy thought it reasonable and gave him the
                job.
                During the next four months, they talked a lot about the conservatory and a lot more about themselves.
                They found out they both like nature and long walks in the countryside, travelling to exotic places,
                and Benidorm, and drag races. No, I'm not talking about RuPaul's, I'm
                talking about the car racing type.
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual building work took three weeks. Neil confessed that he could have done it in two, but he
                enjoyed talking to Mandy so much during those visits that he took his time.
                On the very last day, in the new conservatory, he finally asked Mandy out.
                Two years later, on the same date, and in the very same conservatory, she asked Neil to move in.
                He thought about it for a moment, looked at her and said with a straight face:
                &quot;<span class="font-speech italic">Well, you do have a pretty conservatory</span>&quot;,
                before smiling and putting Mandy out of her misery.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the beginning, living together was not as smooth sailing as you may think, but they soon found their
                rhythm, their flow, their &quot;ecosystem&quot;, as Neil likes to call it.
                They realised how much of a good team they make,
                and at the same time how much they both retain their individuality. Signs of a strong relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you know Mandy, you also know how much she wanted to see the Northern Lights.
                If you don't know Mandy, well, let me just say that she can spend entire afternoons talking about it,
                and how one day she will go and be fortunate enough to actually see them.
                Neil had experienced a few of these afternoons, so one day he decided that THAT would be where he would
                propose.
                They booked the holiday and off they went.
            </p>
            <p>
                Neil, would you believe it, had prepared a whole speech for when the Lights would finally appear, and
                how they would fade away in comparison to Mandy's beauty, etc. etc. etc.
                But it wasn't meant to be and he had to improvise.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the holiday, when they realised they wouldn't see anything, Neil took the ring out of his
                pocket, held it high, and said
                &quot;<span class="font-speech italic">What's that?</span>&quot;.
                Mandy, still looking for the Northern Lights, didn't notice the ring and shouted
                &quot;<span class="font-speech italic">Where? Where?</span>&quot;.
                When it was clear that there were no lights she turned and saw Neil on his knees AND the ring in his
                hands.
                &quot;<span class="font-speech italic">Will you marry me?</span>&quot;
                She thought about it for a moment, looked at him and said with a straight face:
                &quot;<span class="font-speech italic">Well, you did build a pretty conservatory</span>&quot;,
                before smiling and putting Neil out of his misery.
            </p>
            <p>
                So there you have it. This is how they met and fell in love. If they're going to live happily ever after
                I do not know.
                But I know this. They have a very strong circle of friends and a welcoming family to support them.

            <p>
                &quot;Why do you want to get married?&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a question I often ask. Couples give me the most varied answers: love, of course, companionship,
                stability and security are only a few of those.
                But when I asked Mandy and Neil, their answer surprised me:
            </p>
            <p>
                &quot;To celebrate we have found happiness again&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's that word, &quot;again&quot;, that surprised me.
                You see, for many, marriage is a once-in-a-lifetime event.
                For some, it's a rite of passage.
                For Mandy and Neil, it's a statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                A statement of hope, of looking into the future with someone to share it with, of sharing that future
                with someone who loves you, cares for you and accepts you.
                It's also a statement to each other, to say how strong, confident and stable they feel because of the
                other person.
            </p>
            <p>
                And last but certainly not least, a statement to their children, to say how grateful they are to have
                been welcomed by them. They all now have an extra friend to rely on.

                Neil, when I moved to the countryside I didn't think it would turn out to be the best decision of my

                for the excitement that comes with every journey, you are my journey. Like the driver who feels safe and
                secure with the seat-belt fastened, you are my seat-belt. From today, I pledge to you to be your nest,
                your journey and your seat-belt ----- but I'm still not coming to watch you driving.

                Mandy, I was resigned to try and enjoy my life on my own, but then I had to build another conservatory
                and what a conservatory it turned out to be. It is like our relationship: built on solid foundations,
                full of light and joy, and where I want to have my coffee every morning. Thank you Mandy for being the
                conservatory I could never have built on my own. I love you.

            <p>
                We have now reached the moment for Mandy and Neil to exchange rings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, a wedding ring was given to the bride as a symbol of possession. Mandy would like to clearly
                state that this is NOT the case here.
            </p>
            <p>
                In more modern times, a wedding ring is a sign of a promise, and represents the love, honour and
                faithfulness that you have for your spouse.
                It is also a sign of the love you have for each other. A love that should last forever, symbolised by a
                ring that has no beginning nor end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Mandy and Neil have chosen to exchange only one ring. They believe that marriage is one union
                which is better represented by one ring.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ring will be worn ON a chain and BY Mandy. On a chain, and not on her finger, as to symbolise she is
                not Neil's possession.
                And by Mandy for the trust Neil has in her as the custodian of the promises they are about to make to
                each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Josh, can we have the ring and the chain please?
            </p>
            <p>
                Neil please repeat after me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mandy, please keep this ring<br/>

                Mandy and Neil, I wish you a happy and fulfilling life together. It has been a joy working with
                you and thank you for letting me be part of this day.

                Dear guests, it's now time to start the celebrations.
                Mandy and Neil sincerely hope you will be able to stay and party with them. They know life has
                been hard for many of you lately, and they want you to forget all about that, if only for one night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, this garden is surrounded by nothing, and you will be
                able to enjoy the food, the drinks, the music and especially each other, long into the night.
            </p>
            <p>
                And now, families, friends, &quot;plus ones&quot;, gate-crashers, let's hear it one more time for MANDY and NEIL!
