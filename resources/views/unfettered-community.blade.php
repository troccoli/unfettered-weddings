        <x-section-text>
            <p>This is probably the most important section and one of the reasons why I became a wedding celebrant: the
                Unfettered Community.</p>
            <p>So, who are we?
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply put, we are the ones "<span class="italic">not limited by rules or any other controlling influence</span>>".
                But what are these rules?
            </p>
            <p>
                The world is geared towards heterosexual couples, that's a rule. The patriarchal society wants the woman
                to be given away, that's a rule. Marriage is to be “consumed”, that's a rule. I could go on, but I think
                you understand now.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have ever felt that somehow you didn't fit, whether because of your sexual orientation,
                disability, life-style, beliefs, or anything else, then you are part of the Unfettered Community.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am particularly interested in working with people from the LGBTQI+ community, people who identify
                themselves as asexual, pansexual, polyamourous or gender-fluid. But everyone is welcome, really. Who am
                I to judge your choices, life-style, how you identify yourself, what you want to be and how you want to
                be it. It is your life, and you know it best.
