                For many talking about money is a bit awkward. But it shouldn't be. It's your wedding and you need know
                how much it is going to cost you so you can budget it (and choose me because, well, I'm awesome).
            </p>

                My current price for 2022 is Â£600. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
                <li>an initial meeting to discuss your ideas and to get to know each other;</li>
                <li>writing of the script based on the agreed format;</li>
                <li>a rehearsal, if required;</li>
                <li>the delivery of the ceremony on the day;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Travel is usually not included, unless it's around London. I do not own a car so travelling outside
                London is not that easy but can be arranged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accommodation, if necessary, is also not included.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="italic">writing of the script</span> part consist of more than just me writing it.
                You will be involved too, obviously, as it is your ceremony I will be writing and you must be happy
                with it. For this reason the process involves a little bit of back and forth between you and me, where
                the script is tweaked here and there until we, together, nail it!
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you have any request, or are unsure about anything please get in touch. We can discuss anything
                and I am sure we can come to an agreement. After all, we are Unfettered.
            </p>
