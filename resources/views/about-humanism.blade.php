            <p>
                There are plenty of definitions of what humanism is, or rather what people intend for humanism. They are
                all very similar of course and they have plenty in common.

            <p>
                My take on humanism is that it is a way of life, based on mutual respect and a desire to value each person
                as a human being because they are human beings. I don't think we need a supreme entity, sometimes called
                God or a god, to tell us what is right and what is wrong.
