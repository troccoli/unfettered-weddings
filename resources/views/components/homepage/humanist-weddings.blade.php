        <p>
            A humanist wedding is a non-religious ceremony, that is personal to you, and that reflects your
            lifeâ€™s views, your values and principles, and that is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ceremony is tailored to your ideas and your dream of a perfect wedding. Nothing (well almost nothing) is
            out of bound, too embarrassing, unromantic, edgy, or somehow not proper. We are Unfettered.

            Unfortunately, humanist weddings are not yet legally recognised in England and Wales. Humanists UK is
            fighting for a change in the law. Feel free to join the campaign, by following the link below.
