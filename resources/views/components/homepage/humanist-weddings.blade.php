        <p>
            A humanist wedding is a non-religious ceremony, that is personal to you, and that reflects your
            lifeâ€™s views, your values and principles, and that is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ceremony is tailored to your ideas and your dream of a perfect wedding. Nothing (well almost nothing) is
            out of bound, too embarrassing, unromantic, edgy, or somehow not proper. We are Unfettered.
