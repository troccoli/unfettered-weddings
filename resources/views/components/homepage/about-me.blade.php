            I guess you would like to know a little bit more about me. Well, here it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am originally Italian, moved to the UK in late 2000, married to a wonderful husband, atheist and
            viscerally anti-clerical.
        </p>
        <p>
            My humanist journey is a long one. Started as a catholic, as practically all Italians unfortunately, but
            from an early age I wasn’t really convinced. I mean, “he raised after three days? I’m eating his body during
            communion? I don’t understand!”
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing the treatment of homosexuals by the Catholic Church made things easier for me, and that definitely
            was not the organisation I wanted to belong to. But I still struggled, no, that’s not the right word, toyed,
            that’s better, I still toyed with the idea of the existence of god. So, I defined myself as agnostic for a
            few years, until I realised it’s not that I didn’t know if there was a god, I believed there wasn’t one. So,
            that’s why now I consider myself to be an atheist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, one day, I stumbled about the Humanists UK website and started reading, and a bulb went on in my head.
            I was a humanist. I have probably always been a humanist. I just didn’t know I was a humanist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regarding my anti-clericalism, well, that started very early in my life. Never liked them, never will.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re reading this far, first of all well done. Secondly, thank you. And thirdly, let’s now move onto
            lighter stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a software developer by trade, now working on web products. I like baking, my pistachios biscotti and
            lemon bundt are legendary; binging on TV series, currently re-watching the whole Star Trek, and I mean the
            whole of it, 7 series, 31 seasons, 755 episodes; travelling, usually on a beach somewhere; listening to
            music, huuuge Kylie fan here; and generally enjoying myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            From me you can expect a sympathetic ear, a non judgemental view, a caring attitude and some fun. Be in
            touch and we can discuss it further, with no obligations, over a cup of tea, oh, I do like my cup of tea, or
            zoom these days.
